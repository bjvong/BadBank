# BadBank

Welcome to the Bad Bank!

This project is a representation of a full stack application using what I've learned through the MIT xPro course.
I built it to further apply this knowledge as it is not an actual banking application for use with real money.

HOW TO RUN:
After downloading the directory to your machine, npm install for all dependencies.
Run a local Docker container for mongodb database server on port 27017.
run node index.js and navigate to http://localhost:3000/
